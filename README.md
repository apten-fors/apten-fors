# Hi 👋  
I'm @apten-fors — Platform / PaaS engineer focused on cloud-native and AI infrastructure.

I build and operate **Kubernetes-based platforms** that enable teams to run **AI, ML, and high-performance workloads** reliably at scale.

## What I work on
- Internal **PaaS platforms** on Kubernetes (Cluster API, GitOps, self-service workflows)
- **GPU-enabled infrastructure** for AI / ML and LLM workloads
- Platform observability, reliability, and capacity planning
- CI/CD and infrastructure automation

## Core technologies
Kubernetes (K8s) • Cluster API • Helm / Helmfile • ArgoCD  
GPU infrastructure • NVIDIA tooling • MLflow • vLLM / model serving  
Prometheus • VictoriaMetrics • Grafana  
Linux • Python • Go  
OpenStack • Kairos • Envoy • Dragonfly (d7y)

## Current focus
- AI & GPU platform architecture
- Scaling Kubernetes platforms without increasing operational load
- Improving developer experience through platform abstractions
